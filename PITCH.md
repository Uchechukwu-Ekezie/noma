# Zephyra — 60-90s Pitch

Opening (15s):
Zephyra is the first marketplace built specifically for Web3-native domain trading — a secure, decentralized platform where users discover, trade, and negotiate premium blockchain domains across multiple chains.

Problem (15s):
Buying and selling blockchain domains is fragmented. Listings are scattered, messaging between parties is insecure or fragmented, and onboarding remains a UX hurdle.

Solution (20s):
Zephyra unifies discovery, wallets, messaging, and an on-chain orderbook. With Privy-powered auth and embedded wallets, we make onboarding painless. With XMTP messaging built-in, buyers and sellers communicate privately and verifiably.

Demo callout (20s):
In our demo, we’ll show signing up via Privy (embedded wallet), linking an external wallet, sending a private message via XMTP, and placing an order on the orderbook.

Ask (10s):
We’re seeking feedback, partnerships with domain registrars, and tooling support to harden on-chain settlement and scaling.
