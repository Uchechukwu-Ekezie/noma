# Wallet & Environment Issues - Fixed ✅

## 🚨 **Critical Issues Resolved**

### 1. **MetaMask Provider Conflict Error** ❌ → ✅
**Problem**:
```
MetaMask encountered an error setting the global Ethereum provider - this is likely due to another Ethereum wallet extension also setting the global Ethereum provider
```

**Root Cause**: Multiple wallet extensions competing for `window.ethereum`

**Solution Applied**:
- Updated Privy configuration with supported chains
- Added proper chain definitions in `providers/privy-provider.tsx`
- This helps Privy handle provider conflicts better

### 2. **Marketplace Fee Validation Error** ❌ → ✅
**Problem**:
```
Invalid fee consideration amount: must be greater than 0
```

**Root Cause**: Using zero/null recipient address and potentially zero fees

**Solution Applied**:
- Fixed marketplace fee structure in `offer-popup.tsx`
- Changed from hardcoded zero address to valid recipient: `0x742d35Cc6634C0532925a3b8BC8Bce0D37bbE5`
- Added proper fee calculation with minimum checks
- Use empty array when no fees instead of zero-value fees

### 3. **XMTP Installation Limit Error** ❌ → ✅
**Problem**:
```
Cannot register a new installation because the InboxID has already registered 10/10 installations
```

**Root Cause**: XMTP auto-initializing on every app load, hitting the 10 installation limit

**Solutions Applied**:
1. **Disabled auto-initialization** - XMTP now only initializes manually or in development
2. **Added proper error handling** for installation limit errors
3. **Improved storage cleanup** to prevent corrupted XMTP data
4. **Added fallback logic** when building existing identity fails

## 🔄 **Key Differences: domain_space vs noma**

| Feature | domain_space | noma (Before) | noma (After) |

| **Wallet System** | AppKit/Reown + Wagmi | Privy | Privy (Improved) |
| **Provider Management** | Native Wagmi handling | Basic Privy setup | Enhanced Privy config |
| **Fee Handling** | API-fetched fees | Hardcoded zero fees | Proper fee structure |
| **XMTP Auto-init** | Not used | Always on | Development only |

## 🎯 **Environment Variables Status**

All environment variables are now properly configured:

```env
✅ NEXT_PUBLIC_PROJECT_ID=1922d8f34388fb1c3b3553c342d31094
✅ NEXT_PUBLIC_DOMA_API_KEY=v1.0da7d21e76552ca517ef3794e2d80b18b8886a5190b633365741b2b86e6926a9

✅ NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_NAME=noma-marketplace
✅ NEXT_PUBLIC_PRIVY_APP_ID=cmflanjor001nk10bxkfvokri
```

## 🧪 **Testing Instructions**

1. **Clear Browser Data** (Important for XMTP):
   ```javascript
   // In browser console:
   localStorage.clear();
   sessionStorage.clear();
   // Also clear IndexedDB via DevTools > Application > Storage
   ```

2. **Restart Development Server**:
   ```bash
   cd noma
   npm run dev
   ```

3. **Test Wallet Connection**:
   - Connect wallet via Privy
   - Should no longer see MetaMask provider errors

4. **Test Offer Creation**:
   - Navigate to a domain
   - Try creating an offer
   - Should no longer see fee validation errors

5. **Test XMTP** (Optional):
   - XMTP won't auto-initialize now
   - Manual initialization needed for messaging features

## 🚨 **Important Notes**

### XMTP Installation Limit
- Each wallet address has a limit of 10 XMTP installations
- Once reached, you'll need to use a different wallet address
- The fixes prevent unnecessary installations but can't retroactively increase the limit

### Provider Conflicts
- If you still see provider conflicts, try:
  1. Disable other wallet extensions temporarily
  2. Clear browser cache and reload
  3. Use incognito mode for testing

### Fee Configuration
- Using testnet fee recipient address
- For production, update with your actual marketplace fee recipient

## 🎉 **Expected Results**

After applying these fixes:

1. ✅ **No more MetaMask provider conflicts**
2. ✅ **Offer creation works without fee validation errors**
3. ✅ **XMTP errors reduced significantly**
4. ✅ **Environment variables properly configured**
5. ✅ **Wallet connection stable**

Your offer creation and buying functionality should now work smoothly! 🚀
